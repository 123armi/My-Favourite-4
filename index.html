        <p>I don't get why many people don't like reading. For me,it's the best thing in the world. Whenever you're bored, just grab a book and read. See.. It's so simple!! You can increase your vocabulary by reading. Like I usually keep a dictionary with me everytime I read a book. When you don't understand the meaning of a word just open the dictionary and search. Let me also point out a thing - Many children just look at the images of the book and done. I mean, how can they know if it's interesting or not by the pictures?? This is a little similar to the proverb "Don't Judge a book by it's cover". I'll give one example of myself. I used to hate Harry Potter, thinking what's in it. It's just some kid learning magic. Meanwhile my sister used to love it. Now I read the whole Harry Potter Series in about two months and I am addicted to it. I used to keep on reading for hours. No, seriously, I promise you they were literal hours. That too continuosly. Now I am going to reccomend some writers for childrens. Umm mostly who are my favourites. One is JK Rowling. And then Enid Blyton. I am sure you have heard of her. My most favourite series from her is "Famous Five". And then there are books of Geronimo Stilton and group. I don't know the writer's name but definately check him out on google. Now I'm just gonna say Adios fellas. But a secret.. If you read books you're going to be in for a adventure of a lifetime. And if not then</p>
